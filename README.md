Use coef in Logistic Regression, p-value in Linear Regression or feature importance in Random Forest to check the contribution of variables.


Think about the following performance measures that can give more insight into the accuracy of the model than traditional classification accuracy:

Confusion Matrix: A breakdown of predictions into a table showing correct predictions (the diagonal) and the types of incorrect predictions made (what classes incorrect predictions were assigned).
Precision: A measure of a classifiers exactness.
Recall: A measure of a classifiers completeness
F1 Score (or F-score): A weighted average of precision and recall.

Kappa (or Cohenâ€™s kappa): Classification accuracy normalized by the imbalance of the classes in the data.
ROC Curves: Like precision and recall, accuracy is divided into sensitivity and specificity and models can be chosen based on the balance thresholds of these values.
